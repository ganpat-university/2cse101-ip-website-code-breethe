         <h1> What Is Mental Illness?</h1>
         
        A mental illness is a broad term which encompasses a wide variety of conditions which affect the way you feel and 				        think. It can also affect your ability to get through day-to-day life. Mental illnesses can be influenced by several 		different factors, some of which are:
        
        <ul type="circle">

		<li>Environment</li>
		<li>Daily Habits</li> 
	    <li>Biology</li>
        
        </ul>
        
          Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive 				          behaviors.Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental 	          illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
